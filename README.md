# Game Off 2022

## Description

This project started as part of Game Off 2022, but was not completed in time for the game jam's deadline, yet development is still ongoing. The theme of the game jam was "Cliche", so this game is built with the cliche of "Bards are flirtatious in TTRPGs and love to seduce dragons".

The gameplay is a combination of a visual novel and rhythm game, but is still not fully developed.

The project is built in the following environment:

- Unity (2022.1.9f1)

## Installation
