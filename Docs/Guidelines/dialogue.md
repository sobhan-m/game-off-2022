# Dialogue

To ensure a consistent dialogue formatting, here are some guidelines to keep in mind.

## Guidelines

-   Any spoken dialogue should have double-quotes wrapped around it.
-   Descriptions and other non-spoken dialogue should not have quotes around them.
-   Whenever there is spoken dialogue, you include the speaker's name (even if it is the player).
-   Descriptions, expositions, and other non-spoken dialogue should not have a speaker's name.
-   Each dialogue's text should be limited to a single sentence.
-   Dialogues should be written in the first person.
