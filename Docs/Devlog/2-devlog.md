# # Devlog 2 â€” 03-Jun-2023

## What's been done since the last devlog?

I'm happy to report that all of June's goals were reached, and we successfully implemented the enemy AI, player abilities, and the dialogue system to the game. At the moment, the core gameplay loop is there, but there's still a lot to be done.

## What's the plan for this month?

This month's focus is to take the game from a scrappy tech-demo to something that looks much more like a full video game. This is going to be done by adding some nice quality of life features and effects, as well as developing further scenes for the game.

-   **Effects:** I hope to add some visual and sound effects to the game's combat, and some simple musical tracks during the dialogue scenes. This should be done by 10-Jul-2023.
-   **Save System:** I'm going to develop a save system that allows you to create a new game and to continue from where you left off. At the moment, the idea is to only allow a single save, but more saves may be added down the line. I expect to be done with this by 20-Jul-2023
-   **Scene Development:** I plan on adding a few extra scenes to have a rough idea of the first hour or so of the game mapped out. This should be done by 31-Jul-2023.
-   **Dialogue Display:** I am considering modifying the dialogue system to display text as if it's being read in character by character. I don't personally like it when games do this, but I might try adding it in as an option. This is an optional goal if I have time during the month.
